# This data set is a 60,000 matrices of 28x28.
# Each matrix is a grayscale image, with coefficient between 0 and 255

# Train_images[i] is the image of the number
# Train_images[i][x][y] is the pixels of the image
# In general, the first axis (axis 0, because indexing starts at 0)
#   in all data tensors youâ€™ll come across in deep learning will be the samples axis
#   (sometimes called the samples dimension).
# In the MNIST example, samples are images of digits.
